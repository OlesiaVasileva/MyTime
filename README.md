# MyTime
A simple and convenient stopwatch that does not spoil the screen during prolonged use and allows not to be distracted during work. An example of how can use MVVM and Kotlin.

How it works: 
- One click on the Chronometer - starts work,
- Long click on the Chronometer - resets the time, 
- Double click on the area around the Chronometer - pauses.
